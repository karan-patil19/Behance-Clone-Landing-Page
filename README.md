# Behance Clone Landing Page

This project is a simplified clone of the Behance landing page, created as part of an interview task. The focus is on implementing key features such as search with autocompletion, sorting by category, and liking images.

## Features

### Search with Autocompletion
- A search bar at the top of the page allows users to type a keyword.
- The application provides autocomplete suggestions as the user types.

### Sort by Category
- A category dropdown menu allows users to sort projects by different categories.

### Like an Image
- Each image has a "like" button.
- Clicking the button simulates liking the image.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: As the build tool for faster development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the components.
- **React Icons**: For iconography.
- **PropTypes**: For type checking of the props.
